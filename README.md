# Kafka vs. RabbitMQ - MVP Demo

## Overview
This repository provides a **MVP Demo** comparing **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ** as message brokers. The goal is to analyze their performance, scalability, and ease of integration in a real-world scenario.

## Features
- Setup for both **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ** in a local environment
- Producer and Consumer implementations
- Benchmarking message throughput, latency, availability
- Comparison of key features like durability, message ordering, and fault tolerance

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Kafka**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Docker** (for containerized setup)
- **Python** (for producer and consumer applications)

## Comparison Metrics
- **Throughput**: Messages per second processed
- **Latency**: Time taken for message delivery
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
- **Durability**: Message persistence and recovery
- **Ease of Integration**: Simplicity in setting up and using
